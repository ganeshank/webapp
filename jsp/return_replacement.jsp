        <p class="text-justify">We have a "no questions asked return and replacement/refund policy" which entitles all our members to return
		the product at the time of delivery if due to some reason they are not satisfied with the quality or freshness of the product. We will 
		take the returned product back with us and if you had paid the amount, we will refund the full amount. If you want the replacement, 
		we will provide the replacement if stock is available. And if stock is not available we will not be able to provide the replacement,
		so we will refund the amount.</p>
      	<p>Note: This facility is only applicable at the time of delivery(You need to verify the quality at delivery time). Once the order is
		accepted by customer return/replacement is not being possible.</p>
